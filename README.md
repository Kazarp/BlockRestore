BlockRestore
============

<details>
<summary>What happened to this project?</summary>
This plugin was released in 2013 for the first time. It gained a bit of popularity, people claimed it was useful, because they don't want to overkill their servers with WorldEdit just to restore an area.

I abandoned the project for a while and returned just in time to find out about the [DMCA takedown request](https://web.archive.org/web/20150206000441/http://dl.bukkit.org/dmca/notification.txt).

Bukkit was saved by [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/). The API had changed a lot since I last used it and I'm not a part of the Minecraft community anymore, so I doubt the completion of this plugin would have any purpose.
